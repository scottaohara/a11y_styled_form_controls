					<p>
						The typical user expectation for a checkbox is for it
						to be engaged with, and then for an additional action,
						such as submitting a form, to be necessary for the
						updated state of the checkbox to be recognized by the
						website/web app.
					</p>
					<p>
						e.g. a user checking or unchecking an "add me to your mailing list" field.  The action of adding or being removed does not transpire until the form is submitted.
					</p>
					<p>
						As this version of a switch toggle will be announced by
						assistive technologies as a "checkbox", the best place to use
						this pattern would be in the context of a series of form fields
						that were to be submitted all at once.  Or as a switch toggle
						that was coupled with a "Save" or "Submit" button.
