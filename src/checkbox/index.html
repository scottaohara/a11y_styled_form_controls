							Pattern Details

						<details open>
							<summary>Pattern Markup</summary>
						<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div class="c-cb"&gt;
  &lt;input type="checkbox" name="c_input" id="c_input_1" checked&gt;
  &lt;label for="c_input_1"&gt;
    Option 1
  &lt;/label&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
							</details>

						<p>
							When customizing any form control, it must remain accessible to assistive technology and keyboard users. To keep this custom style accessible, a visually hidden checkbox form control is the cornerstone of the custom style.
						</p>

						<p>
							Without the visually hidden checkbox, all checkbox functionality, including keyboard focus and appropriate announcements to screen readers, would need to be rewritten using JavaScript and necessary <abbr>ARIA</abbr> attributes. This would significantly inflate the development effort needed to create a custom styled checkbox.
						</p>

						<p>
							The primary purpose of the wrapping element (<code>div</code> with the <code>.c-cb</code> class) is to act as a styling hook. The element utilizes <code>position: relative;</code> to keep absolute positioned pseudo elements within the bounds of the wrapping element, and not affected by another potential parent element's position property.
						</p>

						<p>
							The form control's <code>label</code> <code>:before</code> and <code>:after</code> pseudo elements are used to create a visual "checkbox" element that can be styled via <abbr>CSS</abbr>. This example merely recreates a recognizable, but custom, checkbox design.
						</p>

						<p>
							The appearance of the custom checkbox is determined by the current state of the native checkbox. <code>:checked</code>, and <code>:focus</code> states, along with a potential <code>disabled</code> state all serve as hooks to visually change the styling of the custom checkbox.
						</p>

						<h4>Affects on Screen Reader Announcements?</h4>

						<p>
							Since the native checkbox remains in the DOM, and is used as the focusable element that controls the state of the custom visualization, there are no alterations to how a screen reader announces styled checkboxes when focused by the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key.
						</p>

						<p>
							Often, people might think to hide their checkbox with a standard "visually-hidden" or "sr-only" CSS ruleset.  These popular rulesets often include <code>position: absolute</code> and squish the native <code>input</code> down to a 1px by 1px invisible dot on the screen.  Using this standard method to visually hide the checkbox will retain its keyboard accessibility, but impose screen reader quirks that should be avoided.
						</p>

						<p>
							For instance, with NVDA 2018.3.2 and Firefox 62 / 64 Nightly, using <code>position: absolute</code> to remove checkboxes from the normal DOM flow creates a separate focus stop when navigating with the virtual cursor. This means that where using the <kbd>down arrow</kbd> key to navigate through the document would typically highlight (virtually focus) a native checkbox once, it instead highlights it twice.
						</p>

						<p>
							This double virtual focus issue doesn't occur with unstyled checkboxes in Firefox + NVDA. This <code>position: absolute</code> behavior also does not occur in Chrome + NVDA.
						</p>

						<p>
							A user can hit the <kbd>up arrow</kbd> or <kbd>down arrow</kbd> keys to navigate between checkboxes and have their accessible names announced.  However, in Firefox + NVDA, when navigating with the <kbd>down arrow</kbd> key NVDA will announce "checkbox [check or unchecked]". A second press of <kbd>down arrow</kbd> will announce "clickable [accessible name of the checkbox]".  <b>Note</b> this separation of the form control from its accessible name does not occur when navigating by <kbd>X</kbd> or <kbd>F</kbd> keys, nor when using the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key to navigate the controls.
						</p>

						<p>
							Along with the NVDA + <code>position: absolute</code> announcement quirk, using standard visually hidden CSS to hide native checkboxes off screen, or as a single pixel in the document, will mean that some screen reader users will likely be unable to locate a checkbox.
						</p>

						<p>
							For instance, people searching by touch, or using a mouse while a screen reader announces what is being hovered (NVDA Mouse setting, "Report role when mouse enters object" turned on, or when using ZoomText Fusion and mouse hovering a custom checkbox).
						</p>
						<p>
							To mitigate a checkbox role not being announced to these people, the checkboxes have been positioned on top of their pseudo element styled counterparts (<code>position: relative;</code> with a <code>z-index</code>). The native checkbox remains visually hidden, but is announces as if it were not (as expected).
						</p>

						<h3>VoiceOver on macOS 10.13.6 + Safari 12</h3>
						<p>
							When re-checking the checkboxes after the latest releases of macOS and Safari, if navigating by <kbd>Tab</kbd> key or <kbd>VO</kbd> cursor, checkboxes will double announce their label.  For instance: <q>Option 1. Option 1.</q>. This only occurs if the checkbox precedes its <code>label</code>. If the checkbox comes after the <code>label</code>, or within it, in the DOM order, this bug will not occur.  This bug does not occur when using Chrome + VoiceOver.  (Bug filed: 45506356)
